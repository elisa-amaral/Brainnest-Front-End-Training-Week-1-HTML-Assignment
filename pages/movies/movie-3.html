                <strong>Elizabeth Gilbert:</strong> At the start of the year-long journey Gilbert memorializes in Eat, Pray, Love, she is physically and emotionally broken. She herself describes her condition as pathetic. The reader watches her heal, grow, and change as the months pass by.

            <li>
                <strong>Ketut Liyer</strong> resisted becoming a healer as a young man, but when he saw the value of the calling and understood his predestined role as a medicine man, he fully embraced it. He works hard every day to help the people who come to him with life's burdens. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>David:</strong> Although David is not physically present in Gilbert's memoir, he is there in her memories, and he is hugely present in her mind for months of her trip. She obsesses over their relationship and repeatedly engages in "what if" thinking about possibly getting back together with him. She admits she still loves him, but knows her love is not a healthy one.

        <h2>Book of Reference: Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia by Elizabeth Gilbert</h2>
        <img src="./../../images/movies/movie-3-book-of-reference.jpg" alt="Cover of the book Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia by Elizabeth Gilbert">
        <p>
            Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia is a 2006 memoir by American author Elizabeth Gilbert. The memoir chronicles the author's trip around the world after her divorce and what she discovered during her travels. The book remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for 187 weeks. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Gilbert followed up this book with Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage, released through Viking in January 2010. It covered her life after Eat, Pray, Love, plus an exploration of the concept of marriage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jennifer Egan of The New York Times described Gilbert's prose as "fueled by a mix of intelligence, wit and colloquial exuberance that is close to irresistible" but said that the book "drags" in the middle. She was more interested in "the awkward, unresolved stuff she must have chosen to leave out," noting that Gilbert omits the "confusion and unfinished business of real life" and that "we know how the story ends pretty much from the beginning."
