                    Ralph Breaks the Internet is the sequel of Wreck-It Ralph (2012). Wreck-It Ralph 2 Little Golden Book is the adaptation of Ralph Breaks the Internet that was adapted by Nancy Parent. This time, Wreck-It Ralph leaves the arcade behind, venturing into the expansive universe of the internet--which may or may not survive Ralph's not-so-light touch. The book is perfect for children ages 2 to 5, as well as Disney Little Golden Book collectors of all ages!
