                Foreign language learning can be defined as learning of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_language" target="_blank">foreign language</a> outside of the environment where it is commonly spoken.
                The many cognitive <a href="https://expressyourselfne.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/top-3-reasons-to-learn-a-new-language4a94a6deef5c6deabfb0ff000028c43c.jpg" target="_blank">benefits</a> of learning languages are undeniable. People who <a href="https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/how-many-languages-can-you-learn/" target="_blank">speak more than one language</a> have improved memory, problem-solving and critical-thinking <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-the-mind-of-the-polyglot-is-a-very-particular-thing-and-scientists-are-only-beginning-jeffrey-kluger-16-9-0932.jpg" target="_blank">skills</a>, enhanced concentration, ability to multitask, and better listening skills.

                A  <a href="https://dailyinfographic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/netflix-most-watched-movies.png" target="_blank">movie</a> may run about two to three hours, but a series does not have any time schedule. Another difference that can be seen between TV series and <a href="https://www.breobox.com/blogs/news/10-benefits-of-watching-movies" target="_blank">movie</a>  is in the commercial breaks. We can come across advertisements in-between a <a href="http://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/2793.jpeg" target="_blank">TV series</a>,  but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_television" target="_blank">series hosted on streaming services</a> usually don't have commercial breaks.

            </strong>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.ukuleletricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/parts-of-the-ukulele.jpg" target="_blank">ukulele</a> also called <em>uke</em>, is a member of the lute family of instruments of Portuguese origin and popularized in Hawaii.

                An <a href="https://www.guitarinsideout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/parts-of-an-acoustic-guitar-diagram-683x1024.jpg" target="_blank">acoustic guitar</a> does not require electrical amplification, having a hollow body that amplifies the vibrations of the strings.

                The most <a href="https://ukuleletricks.com/ukulele-vs-guitar/" target="_blank">obvious difference</a>  between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_guitar" target="_blank">acoustic guitar</a> and ukulele is their size. The ukulele often resembles a small classical guitar, with a much smaller body and only four nylon strings. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukulele" target="_blank">ukulele</a> is tuned differently than a guitar with fewer notes and a much smaller sonic range.
