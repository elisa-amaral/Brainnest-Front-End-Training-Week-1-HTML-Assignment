                        <strong>Saves You Time:</strong>
                        <p>
                            You spend a lot of time preparing for a workout: you have to pack your gym bag, get in the car, drive to the gym, park, change, and then, finally, hit the floor. Exercising at home allows you to bypass all those inconveniences and focus your time and energy on your workout routine.

                        <strong>Saves You Money:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Sure, there are discount gyms, but many memberships tend to cost between $500 â€“ $1,000 per year, not to mention classes, which typically cost extra. By making a small investment in some fitness equipment or using what you've got on hand, you can get in a quality workout without paying a monthly fee.

                        <strong>Offers You Flexibility:</strong>
                        <p>
                            Exercising from home allows you to fit in a workout whenever you're feeling particularly inspired or energized. Many websites offer pre-recorded classes, which means no more fretting over the class filling up. You can also fit in fitness throughout your day, by getting in a couple of quick sets while you wait for your coffee to brew, oatmeal to cook, or Zoom meeting to start.
