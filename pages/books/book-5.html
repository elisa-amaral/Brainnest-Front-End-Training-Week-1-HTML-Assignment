                            <strong>Sherlock Holmes:</strong> a private investigator who works from his home on Baker Street in central London. A devoted pupil of crime studies, he is a zealous believer in the powers of observation and deductive reasoning. Holmes is typically unflappable and reserved, but on occasion he exposes a passionate, creative side. He has no interest in being a part of London society; apart from his relationship with Dr. John Watson, he is something of a loner. He has a renowned reputation, and has been commissioned to tackle cases all over the world.

                           <strong> Dr. John Watson </strong> is Sherlock Holmes's best friend and frequent sidekick. His medical practice isn't very busy, which allows him time to tag along with Holmes during his various crime-solving adventures. Watson is good-natured and smart, but he (like many others) frequently misses clues that are easily detectable to Sherlock Holmes.

                           <strong>Irene Adler:</strong> Though she was born in the United States, Irene Adler's opera career has taken her around Europe, where she meets the King of Bohemia and begins a romantic relationship with him. Her anger at the king causes her to make a rash decision, but she is otherwise poised and shrewd—so much so, in fact, she gets the better of Holmes and the king when they come looking for the photos she holds of her ex-lover.

                            <strong>Inspector Lestrade</strong> is a long-serving investigator at Scotland Yard, the police force of the city of London, but his main role is foil to Sherlock Holmes, who frequently exposes his incompetence. He represents the establishment, and accordingly he is conventional in every way—including his thinking. He has a prominent role in "The Boscombe Valley Mystery" and "The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor."

                    Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ DL was a British writer and physician. He created the character Sherlock Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of four novels and fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. The Sherlock Holmes stories are milestones in the field of crime fiction.

                <p>
                    Doyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories, his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about Professor Challenger and humorous stories about the Napoleonic soldier Brigadier Gerard, as well as plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction, and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, "J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the Mary Celeste.

                <p>
                    Doyle is often referred to as "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle" or "Conan Doyle", implying that "Conan" is part of a compound surname rather than a middle name. His baptism entry in the register of St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, gives "Arthur Ignatius Conan" as his given names and "Doyle" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his godfather.[1] The catalogues of the British Library and the Library of Congress treat "Doyle" alone as his surname.
