                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Dorothy:</strong> A bright and resourceful child who handles being transported into a new realm with resolve, good cheer, and an unwavering eagerness to return home. Though apparently younger than her companions (according to some readers' calculations, she is about 10 years old), she is as protective of them as they are of her. When confronted with evil (the Wicked Witch of the West) or with deception (Oz), Dorothy's strong sense of fairness upholds her.

                            <strong>Scarecrow:</strong> Though the Scarecrow's dearest wish is that Oz give him a brain, he is already possessed of native intelligence. He learns quickly and usually comes up with a helpful idea when the travelers face a challenge.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Tin Woodman:</strong> The Woodman's goal is to obtain a heart from Oz. Yet he is already as sensitive and "tender-hearted" as if he had a real heart. He is brave and protective, but the sight of a friend or animal in trouble brings him to tears.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Cowardly Lion:</strong> The Cowardly Lion isn't really the coward he believes himself to be. He proves himself brave and daring many times before Oz consents to provide him with courage.

                    The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. An adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 children's fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the film was primarily directed by Victor Fleming (who left the production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind), and stars Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton.

                    Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, but others made uncredited contributions. The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart, with the lyrics written by Edgar "Yip" Harburg. His works anticipated such later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), and the ubiquity of clothes advertising (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work).

                    Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school at the age of 12 to work in a boot-blacking factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. After three years he returned to school, before he began his literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, for education, and for other social reforms.
